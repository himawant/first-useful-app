YC's Tom Blomfield has spent the last month building side projects with tools like Claude Code, Windsurf, and Aqua, seeing just how far you can push modern LLMs. From writing full-stack apps to debugging with a single paste of an error message, AI is becoming a legit collaborator in the dev process. This video is a playbook for anyone who wants to get the most out of vibe coding and build faster.

Dr. Fei-Fei Li is often called the godmother of AI\u2014and for good reason. Before the world had AI as we know it, she was helping build the foundation.  In this fireside, she recounts the creation of ImageNet, a project that helped ignite the deep learning revolution by providing the data backbone modern computer vision needed. She walks through the early belief in data-driven methods, the shock of seeing convolutional networks outperform expectations in 2012, and how those breakthroughs led to captioning, storytelling, and ultimately, generative models.  Now, she\u2019s taking on one of AI\u2019s hardest frontiers: spatial intelligence. Fei-Fei shares why modeling the 3D world is essential for AGI\u2014and why it may be even more difficult than language.
